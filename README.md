<h3 align="center">Fixed Bugs:</h3>

- __Implementation timed buttons disabling__

<br>

- PROBLEM: (JS) While implementing timer counting time for buttons disabling between rounds ran into issue that timer was working sometimes and sometimes not. Apparently problem source was recognized as id on buttons was used on few elements which is not allowed and caused issues.
